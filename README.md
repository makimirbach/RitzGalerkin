# RitzGalerkin
Visualization of numerical solutions of DEQ

### applicable to
DEQ of the form *a_2 u'' + a_1 u' + a_0 u* with boundary conditions at *a,b*. Each either on *u* or *u'* 

Enter some approach functions. Those have to have zeros at any point with a condition on *u*.
Build sets of approach functions and apply Ritz-Galerkin to them. For each set, you recieve a numerical solution of the deq and its plot.
Plotting them in the same plot displays the effect of different approach functions.
